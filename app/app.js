//A module takes two arguments, the first is the name of it, the second is an array of dependencies. This is kind of like the require idea from Browserify - what do you need to function?. If you don't have any dependencies then you can leave it as an empty array. You should add the ng-app="TodoApp" to the body or html tag in your html.
//
//ngRoute is the name of the module for angular-route
var app = angular.module("TodoApp", ["ngRoute"]);

//We get routeProvider from ngRoute
app.config(function($routeProvider){
  $routeProvider
    .when('/items/list', {
      //U is captalized but r and l are not!
      templateUrl: 'partials/item-list.html',
      controller: 'TodoCtrl'
    })
    .when('/items/new', {
      templateUrl: 'partials/item-form.html',
      controller: 'TodoCtrl'
    })
    .otherwise('/items/list');
});
